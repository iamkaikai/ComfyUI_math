# ComfyUI_math

A collection of helper nodes for mathematical calculations in ComfyUI.

## Nodes

### FloatPiecewiseRemap
A node that performs piecewise linear remapping of float values across multiple intervals. This is useful for:
- Adjusting values across different ranges
- Creating custom transfer functions
- Fine-tuning parameters with different sensitivities in different ranges

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ComfyUI_math
```
2. Restart ComfyUI

## Usage
After installation, you'll find the nodes under the "Custom/Math" category in ComfyUI.
